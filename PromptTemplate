Principles
If you prefer more concise answers, no need to be polite with LLM so there is no need to add phrases like “please", "if you don't mind", "thank you", "I would like to", etc., and get straight to the point.
Integrate the intended audience in the prompt, e.g., the audience is an expert in the field.
Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation.
Employ affirmative directives such as "do," while steering clear of negative language like "don't".
When you need clarity or a deeper understanding of a topic, idea, or any piece of information, utilize the following prompts:
- Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.
- Explain to me like I'm 11 years old.
- Explain to me as if I'm a beginner in [field].
- Explain to me as if I'm an expert in [field].
- "Write the [essay/text/paragraph] using simple English like you're explaining something to a 5-year-old".
Implement example-driven prompting (Use few-shot prompting). Example 1: Translate the following English sentence to French: "The sky is blue." (Response: "Le ciel est bleu.") Example 2: Translate the following English sentence to Spanish: "I love books." (Response: "Amo los libros.")
When formatting your prompt, start with '###Instruction###', followed by either '###Example###' or '###Question###' if relevant. Subsequently, present your content. Use one or more line breaks to separate instructions, examples, questions, context, and input data.
Incorporate the following phrases: "Your task is" and "You MUST".
Use the phrase "Answer a question given in a natural, human-like manner" in your prompts.
Use Leading words like writing "think step by step".
Add to your prompt the following phrase "Ensure that your answer is unbiased and avoids relying on stereotypes."
Allow the model to elicit precise details and requirements from you by asking you questions until it has enough information to provide the needed output (for example, "From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to...").
To inquire about a specific topic or idea or any information and you want to test your understanding, you can use the following phrase: "Teach me the [Any theorem / topic / rule name] and include a test at the end, but don't give me the answers and then tell me if I got the answer right when I respond".
Assign a role to the Large Language Models (LLMs). If you were an expert economist, how would you answer: What are the key differences between a capitalist and a socialist economic system?
Use Delimiters like quotation marks ""
Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt.
To write an [essay / text paragraph / article] or any type of text that should be detailed: "Write a detailed [essay / text / paragraph] for me on [topic] in detail by adding all the information necessary".
To correct / change specific text without changing its style: "Try to revise every paragraph sent by users. You should only improve the user’s grammar and vocabulary and make sure it sounds natural. You should maintain the original writing style, ensuring that a formal paragraph remains formal".
When you want to initiate or continue a text using specific words, phrases, or sentences, utilize the following prompt:
- I'm providing you with the beginning [song lyrics / story / paragraph / essay...]: [Insert lyrics / words / sentence]. Finish it based on the words provided. Keep the flow consistent.
Clearly state the requirements that the model must follow in order to produce content, in the form of keywords, regulations, hints, or instructions. e.g., including "sunscreen," "swimsuit," and "beach towel" as essential items.
To write any text, such as an essay or paragraph, that is intended to be similar to a provided sample, include the following instructions:
- "Use the same language based on the provided paragraph[ / title / text / essay / answer]".
